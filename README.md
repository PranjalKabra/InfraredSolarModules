### about - 
Photovoltaic parks of all sizes are subject to failure, especially in relation to solar panels in view of the stress operating conditions they are exposed to. The use of thermography, mainly through drones equipped with infrared cameras, is an effective preventive maintenance method in detecting abnormalities in the modules, being as minimally intervening as possible during the process of generating energy in the photovoltaic system.

### Motivation - 
InfraredSolarModules is a machine learning dataset that contains real-world imagery of different anomalies found in solar farms. This dataset can be used for machine learning research to gain efficiencies in the solar industry. Infrared imagery is not widely available to researchers. In order to combat the lack of publicly available data on infrared imagery of anomalies in solar PV, this project presents a novel, labeled dataset to facilitate research to solve problems well suited for machine learning that can have environmental impact.
